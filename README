Tiny-Vec
========
A dynamic array with an initial stack-based buffer, for small collections.

It aims to have a similar API to std::vec::Vec, but allowing to optimize
small lists. It starts as a stack-based buffer, and automatically switches
to the heap when the capacity grows over a certain number of elements.

The tiny-str crate provides TinyString, which is a String backed by a
TinyVec, just like std::string::String is built on top of std::vec::Vec.

== Documentation ==
To build the documentation, run `cargo doc`
Or browse it online at
- https://docs.rs/tiny-vec
- https://docs.rs/tiny-str

== Features ==
These features are only usable on nightly compilers, that's why they are
disabled by default.

use-specialization
    Enables specialization for trait impls
    For example, From<&[T]> where T is Copy can be optimized as a ptr::copy.
    We can specialize that case, while still allowing From<&[T]> for the
    types that only implement Clone.

default-size
    Adds the option to not specify a capacity for the stack buffer, which
    will default to the maximun capacity that fits in the RawVec's space.
    This default size causes no memory waste when switching to the heap.
